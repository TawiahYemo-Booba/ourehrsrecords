    <h2>ABOUT</h2>
    <p>We are biomedical engineering students in Ghana, West Africa. We have seen firsthand the challenges of keeping medical records. Traditional record keeping are often unreliable with patients record being lost, and it can be difficult to keep track of patient data. This can lead to errors in diagnosis and treatment, and it can also make it difficult to provide continuity of care.
        We believe that our affordable, safe, and easy-to-use medical record keeping website can help to address these challenges. Our Sankofa Medical Vault will provide a secure and convenient way to store, access, and share patient records. This can help to improve the quality of care, reduce costs, and improve access to healthcare.
         We work to provide a world class medical record keeping alternative for developing countries in West Africa. We believe that this website can make a real difference in the lives of patients and healthcare providers in our region.</p>
